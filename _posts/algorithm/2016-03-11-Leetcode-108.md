### Leetcode 108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree

- Question
  - Given an array where elements are sorted in "ascending" order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

- Idea to Solve The Problem
  - To ensure it's height balanced BST
  - We can choose the mid as root every time,
  - 0~mid as left subtree and mid~length as right subtree
  - Obviously the length of left subtree and right subtree are equal

```java
public TreeNode sortedArrayToBST(int[] nums) {
      return getTree(nums, 0 , nums.length-1);
    }

public TreeNode getTree(int[] nums, int low, int high){
    if(low>high) return null;
    int mid = (low + high)/2;
    TreeNode root = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
    root.left = getTree( nums,low, mid -1 );
    root.right= getTree(nums, mid+1, high);
    return root;
  }
```
