## 需求

产生Netflow数据(Netflow Simulator or Netflow Exporter)，发送到Fluentd。

## Softflowd(Netflow Exporter)

Softflowd能够通过"监听网络接口"或者"读取抓包文件"来追踪的网络流，
并且能将这些追踪到的网络流以Netflow的形式报送给其他收集者。

Softflowd is flow-based network traffic analyser capable of Cisco NetFlow™ data export.
Softflowd semi-statefully tracks traffic flows
recorded by listening on a network interface or by reading a packet capture file.
These flows may be reported via NetFlow™ to a collecting host or summarised within softflowd itself.

Softflowd is developed on Linux and OpenBSD. It requires libpcap and its associated headers to build.

[Go to Softflowd](http://www.mindrot.org/projects/softflowd/)

If you are using OpenBSD, you may be interested in [pfflowd](http://www.mindrot.org/projects/pfflowd/)
software instead.

## Install on Ubuntu

```
Softflowd is developed on Linux and OpenBSD.
It requires libpcap and its associated headers to build.
So you need to install libpcap first.

$ sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev
$ sudo apt-get install softflowd
```

## Export Netflow to the Same Server or Anthoer Server

```
Terminal 1
$ sudo softflowd -D -v 9 -i any -n 10.157.8.243:6666 -L 64 -T full

Terminal 2
$ sudo tcpdump -n -v -i any dst port 6666
```
